## ⚡ Project Overview

**MiroFish** is a next-generation AI prediction engine powered by multi-agent technology. By extracting seed information from the real world (such as breaking news, policy drafts, and financial signals), it automatically constructs a high-fidelity parallel digital world. Within this space, thousands of agents -- each with independent personalities, long-term memory, and behavioral logic -- freely interact and undergo social evolution. You can dynamically inject variables from a "God's-eye view" to precisely simulate future trajectories -- **letting the future rehearse in a digital sandbox so that decisions can prevail after a hundred simulated battles**.

> You simply need to: upload seed materials (a data analysis report or an interesting novel) and describe your prediction needs in natural language</br>
> MiroFish will return: a detailed prediction report and a high-fidelity digital world you can deeply interact with

### Our Vision

MiroFish is dedicated to building a swarm intelligence mirror that maps reality. By capturing the emergent behaviors arising from individual interactions, it breaks through the limitations of traditional prediction:

- **At the macro level**: We serve as a rehearsal laboratory for decision-makers, allowing policies and public relations strategies to be tested at zero risk
- **At the micro level**: We serve as a creative sandbox for individual users -- whether extrapolating a novel's ending or exploring wild ideas, it's fun, engaging, and within reach

From serious prediction to playful simulation, we make it possible to see the outcome of every "what if," making it possible to predict anything.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Graph Building**: Real-world seed extraction & individual/group memory injection & GraphRAG construction
2. **Environment Setup**: Entity-relationship extraction & persona generation & environment configuration agent injecting simulation parameters
3. **Run Simulation**: Dual-platform parallel simulation & automatic parsing of prediction requirements & dynamic temporal memory updates
4. **Report Generation**: ReportAgent leverages a rich toolset to deeply interact with the post-simulation environment
5. **Deep Interaction**: Chat with any individual in the simulated world & interact with the ReportAgent

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Source Code Deployment (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version Requirement | Description | Installation Check |
|------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Node.js** | 18+ | Frontend runtime environment, includes npm | `node -v` |
| **Python** | >=3.11, <=3.12 | Backend runtime environment | `python --version` |
| **uv** | Latest | Python package manager | `uv --version` |

#### 1. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example configuration file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file and fill in the required API keys
```

**Required environment variables:**

```env
# LLM API Configuration (supports any LLM API compatible with the OpenAI SDK format)
# Recommended: Alibaba Bailian platform qwen-plus model: https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/
# Note: resource consumption can be significant; try a simulation with fewer than 40 rounds first
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
LLM_MODEL_NAME=qwen-plus

# Zep Cloud Configuration
# The free monthly quota is sufficient for basic usage: https://app.getzep.com/
ZEP_API_KEY=your_zep_api_key
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# One-command install of all dependencies (root + frontend + backend)
npm run setup:all
```

Or install step by step:

```bash
# Install Node dependencies (root + frontend)
npm run setup

# Install Python dependencies (backend, automatically creates a virtual environment)
npm run setup:backend
```

#### 3. Start Services

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend (run from the project root directory)
npm run dev
```

**Service URLs:**
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5001`

**Start individually:**

```bash
npm run backend   # Start backend only
npm run frontend  # Start frontend only
```

### 2. Docker Deployment

```bash
# 1. Configure environment variables (same as source code deployment)
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Pull images and start
docker compose up -d
```

By default, it reads the `.env` file from the root directory and maps ports `3000 (frontend) / 5001 (backend)`.

> Accelerated mirror addresses are provided as comments in `docker-compose.yml` and can be substituted as needed.
